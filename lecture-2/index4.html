                options: ["One-to-One", "One-to-Many", "Many-to-Many"],
                answer: "One-to-One",
                explanation: "Correct! Each user has only one profile, and each profile belongs to only one user. This is a classic One-to-One relationship."

                question: "2. An online store has products. Each product can be in many different customer shopping carts, and each cart can contain many products. What relationship describes this?",
                options: ["One-to-One", "One-to-Many", "Many-to-Many"],
                answer: "Many-to-Many",
                explanation: "Exactly! Since a product can be in many carts and a cart can have many products, it's a Many-to-Many relationship, which would need a junction table."
            },
            {
                question: "3. A manager is in charge of several employees, but each employee reports to only one manager. What is this relationship?",

                answer: "One-to-Many",

                question: "4. Which relationship type always requires a 'junction table' or 'linking table' to connect the two main tables?",

                answer: "Many-to-Many",
                explanation: "Correct. A Many-to-Many relationship cannot be implemented directly and requires a third table to link the records from the two other tables."
            },
            {
                question: "5. A country has one official flag, and that specific flag design belongs to only one country. What is this relationship?",
